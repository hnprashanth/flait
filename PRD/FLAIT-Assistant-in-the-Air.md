# FLAIT - Assistant in the Air

You check bags at the counter and 10 mins later realize flight is delayed by few hours & you will miss your connection resulting in one full day delay to destination! But bags are checked and you are stuck! Airlines postpone their alerts to be as late as possible! Other apps, may have this information but never triggered a notification to catch your attention.

You are in flight, you have a connection and you wonder how much time you will get for your connection and whether you will make it or not. How much time is needed for you to change gates? which gate it is going to be? do you need to collect your bags before next flight? You have so many questions but no internet apart from WhatsApp.

Introducing FLAIT! Your assistant in the air! FLAIT works inside Whatsapp, so you won’t miss any updates and you don’t have to get an expensive inflight internet pack! Share your trip details and FLAIT will continuously monitor your flights & airport operations. You will receive alerts just when you need it on WhatsApp without you having to check your phone constantly.
